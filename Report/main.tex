Advances in biologging technology have made a vast amount of high-frequency time series data available in a variety of fields. These data often exhibit complicated temporal dependence structures which cannot be modelled using common methods of Functional Data Analysis (FDA). Animal movement modellers often employ a hierarchical approach using hidden Markov models (HMMs) instead, but many intricate fine-scale processes violate basic assumptions of HMMs. We detail a general hierarchical approach based on HMMs which incorporates a wider class of models at fine scales. As a case study, we build a hierarchical model that combines an HMM with a moving-window auto-regressive process to describe the movement of a killer whale off the western coast of Canada. Our model produces more interpretable results as well as more accurate parameter and standard error estimates compared to existing baselines.

Sequences of curves sampled at high-frequency in time are increasingly common in practice, but they can exhibit complicated dependence structures which cannot be modelled using common methods of Functional Data Analysis (FDA). We detail a hierarchical approach which treats the curves as observations from a hidden Markov model (HMM). The distribution of each curve is then defined by another general fine-scale model which may involve a variety of methods such as moving-window transformations, Fourier analysis, and auto-correlation. As a case study, we use this framework to model the movement of a killer whale off the western coast of Canada. Through simulations we show that our model produces more interpretable state estimation and more accurate parameter estimates compared to existing baselines. This approach is broadly applicable to sequences of curves exhibiting intricate dependence structures.
