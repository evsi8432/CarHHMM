\section{Introduction}

The field of animal movement is in the midst of a ``data renaissance" where advancements in tagging technology have given rise to an explosion of data available for statistical modeling. In particular, tagging technologies are capable of recording observations at rates of tens of hertz, resulting in time series containing millions of observations over the course of several hours. This results in a vast amount of data which often exhibits many different simultaneous behavioral processes occurring at different time scales. 

One solution to this issue is to use a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM). HHMMs model the entire system as a nested structure of hidden Markov models (HMM) where each HMM corresponds to one behavioral process. One nice property of HHMMs is that its likelihood is relatively easy to compute, facilitating fast maximum likelihood estimates for its associated parameters.  

At the shortest time scales, however, observations often exhibit complicated dependence structures which cannot be easily captured by a traditional HMMs. To address this issue, it is possible to model small-scale animal behavior as the solution to some stochastic differential equation, but these methods tend to be computationally intractable and require approximate inference techniques such as Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

This work investigates how to incorporate fine-scale processes into the larger structure of hierarchical hidden Markov models while maintaining computational efficiency. We bridge the gap between discrete hidden Markov models and continuous-time stochastic process models by showing that the two are equivalent under certain conditions. In addition, we extract features from highly structured sub-dive behaviors using signal processing techniques. These features otherwise could not be modeled with a simple HMM. Finally, we apply our method to dive data collected from two Northern resident killer whales off the coast of British Columbia, Canada.

The field of animal movement is in the midst of a ``data renaissance" in which advancements in tagging technology have given rise to an explosion of data available for statistical modeling. In response, researchers have introduced a variety of new statistical techniques to infer animal behavior from movement data \cite{Hooten:2017}. 

These techniques usually fall into one of two different categories: continuous-time models and discrete-time models. Continuous-time models often model the dynamics of an animal as the solution to some stochastic differential equation and can incorporate observations taken at irregular time intervals. These methods are often computationally intractable and require approximate inference techniques such as Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to perform inference. On the other hand, discrete-time techniques use summary statistics taken at discrete time steps to model the animal's behavior and require that observations be taken at regular time intervals. The primary advantage of discrete-time methods is that the associated likelihood is relatively easy to compute, facilitating fast maximum likelihood estimates for parameters. 

One of the most prevalent discrete-time techniques in the literature of late is the hidden Markov model (HMM), where observations depend upon the state of an associated unobserved behavioral process following Markovian dynamics \cite{Patterson:2017}. Importantly, under the traditional HMM model, subsequent observations are assumed to be independent from one another conditioned on the underlying behavioral process. However, this assumption is often violated in the real world processes. For example, the location of an animal at a given time is highly correlated with the location of that animal one second later. Several publications have dealt with this issue in the past, including the hidden movement Markov model (HMMM) by Whoriskey et al \cite{Whoriskey:2016}. 

\textit{The conditionally autoregressive hidden Markov model (CarHMM): Inferring Behavioral States from animal tracking data exhibiting conditional autocorrelation} by Ethan Lawler, Kim Whoriskey, William H. Aeberhard, Chris Fields, and Joanna Mills Flemming introduces a new framework to model autocorrelation in hidden Markov models. The paper also recommends several best practices for data exploration, model selection, and data preprocessing. This paper summarizes the findings of Lawler et al, elaborates on some of the findings and recommendations within, and draws a connection between the CarHMM and a continuous-time method presented by Michelot et al \cite{Michelot:2019}. The CarHMM is also adapted and applied to real-world dive data to analyze the intra-dive behavior of a killer whale off the coast of British Columbia, Canada.
